# Note Taker

for this assignment I had to leverage Express and Render to create an application that would show a note taker, where if I were a small business owner, or just an organized person I could use the note taker to create notes witha  title and a description about what I needed to accomplish or remember. The notes would be saved in a left hand column and I can delete the notes when I am finished.
